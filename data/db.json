Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use\nLorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over\nthe years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the\nlike).\n\n\nWhere does it come from?\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is\nnot simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature\nfrom 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor\nat Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin\nwords, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of\nthe word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum\ncomes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The\nExtremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise\non the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of\nLorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section\n1.10.32.\n\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced\nbelow for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus\nBonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form,\naccompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.\n\nWhere\ncan I get some?\nThere are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available,\nbut the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or\nrandomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to\nuse a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything\nembarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the\nInternet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first\ntrue generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words,\ncombined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum\nwhich looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from\nrepetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.",
